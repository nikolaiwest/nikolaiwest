## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Nick, a researcher at the Institute of Production Systems at TU Dortmund University. Here, I lead the "Smart Quality" research group and work on applying data analytics to manufacturing problems.

### What I work on
* Anomaly detection in time series data (screwdriving systems, production monitoring)
* Prediction of dynamic bottlenecks in serial manufacturing
* Deep learning and reinforcement learning for production planning 
* Industry 4.0 and IoT applications using analytics platforms
